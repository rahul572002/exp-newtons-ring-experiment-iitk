Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|  The simulator will automatically select the medium and the light source which we can change. <br> | Firstly, student will   switch on the light source.<br>  | Student will switch on the light source. And understanding about apperatus. <br>   
2.|  Simulator will allow the student to adjust the microscope position. <br> | Student will be able to handle and adjust the microscope by dragging the cursor. <br> |To set the pointer on first ring.
3.|  Simulator will show the reading on Vernier Scale as we move the microscope position to the right side. <br> | Student will be able to measure the readings taken on the Vernier scale.<br> | To measure the distance between alternative Newton’s rings on the right side.
4.|  Simulator will show the reading on Vernier Scale as we move the microscope position to the left side.<br> | Student will be able to measure the readings taken on the Vernier scale.<br> | To measure the distance between alternative Newton’s rings on the left side.
5.|  Now the simulator will show the table according to the number of readings taken.<br> | Student will fill the value of Vernier Scale in the observation table.<br> | To calculate the diameter of the Newton’s Ring. Through which we calculate the wavelength of sodium light.
